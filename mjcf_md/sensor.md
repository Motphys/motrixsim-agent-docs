|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `body` | `string` | yes | `""""` | The name of the body where the kinematic subtree is rooted. |
| `name` | `string` | no | — | Name of the sensor. |
| `noise` | `real` | yes | `0.0` | The standard deviation of zero-mean Gaussian noise added to the sensor output. Noise  is added in the same units as the sensor output. |
| `cutoff` | `real` | yes | `0.0` | The cutoff value for the sensor output. If the sensor output exceeds this value in  absolute terms, it is clipped to this value. |
| `user` | `real(n)` | yes | `""` | User-defined scalar data associated with the sensor. These values are not used by  the simulator and are passed through to the model without change. |

## sensor/contact

**Path**: `sensor/contact`
**Tag**: `contact`
**Parent**: `sensor`
**Children**: none
**Rust Type**: `model::sensor::sensors::SensorContact`

Sensor data for a contact sensor that detects and reports properties of contact events.

 The contact sensor detects contacts between pairs of
 geoms, bodies, or subtrees, or contacts associated with a site. Multiple filtering
 attributes can be specified to narrow the set of contacts detected. The sensor can
 report various contact properties such as whether contact was found, the contact force,
 torque, distance, position, normal, or tangent direction.

Note

 Exactly one of the following filter groups may be used at a time: (geom1, geom2),
 (body1, body2), (subtree1, subtree2), or site. These groups are mutually exclusive
 and cannot be combined.

 The following describes how motrixsim's contact sensor output differs from MuJoCo:
 - `found`: Reports the total **count** of matching contacts, not a 0/1 boolean.
 - `site` filter: Parsed but **not yet supported** at runtime; the sensor will be ignored.

### Attributes

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | no | — | Name of the sensor. |
| `geom1` | `string` | no | — | Name of the first geom used to filter contacts. Must be paired with geom2; cannot  be combined with body, subtree, or site filters. |
| `geom2` | `string` | no | — | Name of the second geom used to filter contacts. Must be paired with geom1; cannot  be combined with body, subtree, or site filters. |
| `body1` | `string` | no | — | Name of the first body used to filter contacts. Must be paired with body2; cannot  be combined with geom, subtree, or site filters. |
| `body2` | `string` | no | — | Name of the second body used to filter contacts. Must be paired with body1; cannot  be combined with geom, subtree, or site filters. |
| `subtree1` | `string` | no | — | Name of the first body subtree used to filter contacts. All contacts involving any  geom in this subtree will be considered. Must be paired with subtree2; cannot be  combined with geom, body, or site filters. |
| `subtree2` | `string` | no | — | Name of the second body subtree used to filter contacts. Must be paired with  subtree1; cannot be combined with geom, body, or site filters. |
| `site` | `string` | no | — | Name of the site used to filter contacts. Contacts associated with this site will  be considered. Cannot be combined with geom, body, or subtree filters. |
| `num` | `int` | yes | `1` | The maximum number of contacts to detect and report. When more contacts are found  than this value, only the first contacts (up to this limit) are used, unless a  reduction method is specified. |
| `data` | `real(n)` | yes | `"found"` | The type or types of contact data to report in the sensor output. Multiple data  types may be listed in sequence. |
| `reduce` | `string` | yes | `"none"` | The method used to reduce multiple contacts to a single output value. Choice: `none`, `mindist`, `maxforce`, `netforce`. |
